I chose Software Engineering for a plethora of reasons.  I've always been interested in developing software.  Yet, my passion and desire increased even the more after having my last 2 of 3 children.  Both have autism, and absolutely loves technology.  Technology is a huge part of their lives, development, therapy, fun, learning, etc.  They are very savvy with Roblox, Minecraft, and other interactive games/software.  Most of their learning is via technology.  I would love to develop software to aide the autistic community.  I am so blessed that my two children are verbal.  Yet, I know so many parents who have children who are nonverbal, and I see the huge impact technology has on their daily lives.  Oftentimes, for kiddos and adults living with autism, technology is their primary way of communicating, and is a way for parent and child to bond, if only for a moment.  

Giving back, community service, volunteering, seeing a need and finding ways to meet that particular need have all been an enormous part of my life and passion that I pursue any opportunity I have.  Software engineering will allow me to continue giving back, while also earning a meaningful wage for my family and children.  My husband (who was a proud Navy Veteran) passed away three years ago, and Software Engineering will allow me to care for my family while being fulfilled in a meaningful career!
